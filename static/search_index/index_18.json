It does not require the effort of using the mouse to typeset like a rich text editor like Word, and the document is in plain text format, making it easy to modify. and version management. This article mainly introduces how to understand and learn `Markdown` syntax. ## Markdown composition Markdown generally consists of a **plain text content** and a **renderer**. Plain text is a document written according to `Markdown` syntax. The renderer converts the plain text content into an easy to read format such as HTML. tool. `Markdown` is generally used in two places: 1. Website: When filling in content on a website, if it supports `Markdown` syntax, you can directly use `Markdown` syntax to edit the content. Generally, the preview function will be automatically rendered. 2. Offline tools, such as `Typora`, `VS Code`, etc. These tools generally have preview functions and can render in real time. The `Markdown` syntax uses special symbols to control the format, such as `#` for the title, `[Text displayed in the link](https://***)` for the link, etc. ## Simple example Text file `test.md`: ```markdown # About how to learn Markdown syntax ## What is Markdown Markdown generally consists of a **plain text content** and a **renderer**.
